Before running the project make sure to create a `.env` file in the root directory with the required environment variables. refer to the `.env.example` file for the required variables.

Requirements:
- Postgres
- Redis

I will be creating a seeder which will seed the database with some dummy data (in millions probably).

Just for the fun I will also be creating a frontend for this project
Will recreate this in Golang too
